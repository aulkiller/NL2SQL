Terms,Description
Geographical Granularity,"Geographical Granularity refers to the granularity or relationship between geographic dimension like PSM, Region, Estate, Division, Complex, and Block with one to many relationship between them. There are 7 PSM (PSM-1, PSM-2, PSM-3, PSM-5, PSM-6, PSM-6A, PSM-7), each PSM consist of multiple Region, each region consist of multiple estate, each estate consist of multiple division, each division consist of multiple complex, and each complex consist of multiple block. 
A dataset can have block until PSM as the smallest granularity (data granularity per row). So let's say we want to calculate a metric (e.g. FFB production, Harvester output, etc) of an estate XYXE from dataset which have a block as the smallest granularity. We have to first sum up (aggregation) the metric values from all blocks which belong to estate XYXE.
Usually a granularity is defined in the question. If the question doesn't mention any graphical granularity, then assume the geographical granularity for that question is all PSM as a default. So let's say there is a question ""Give me the FFB production for year 2023"", then calculate the FFB production from each PSM then show those calculated value for PSM (aggregated from the smallest granularity) for all psm."
PSM,"PSM stands for Perkebunan Sinar Mas, one PSM consist of several regions. Ex: PSM-1, PSM-2, PSM-3, PSM-5, PSM-6, PSM-6A, PSM-7"
Region,"Each region belongs to one PSM. Each region consist of multiple estates. Ex: BABEL, KALTENG, KAMPAR"
Estate,"Each estate belongs to one Region. Each estate consist of multiple division. Estate also can be called kebun, and each kebun has its own unit code like SBGE, MTNA, ADPE, PHLE, etc. Every unit is an abbreviation of the estate name. For example, PHLE stands for Padang Halaban Estate. Estate can be classified into 3 types, which are Inti, Plasma, and All. All here means a combination of inti and plasma."
Inti,Estate which belong to inti types/category means it the estate that owned and managed by Sinar Mas.
Plasma,"Estate which belong to plasma types/category means it the estate is managed by Sinar Mas but not owned by Sinarmas, the estate is owned by local farmers. Plasma estate can be divided to plasma managed and plasma unmanaged."
Plasma Managed,Plasma managed means it is a plasma estate that is still managed by sinar mas
Plasma Unmanaged,Plasma unmanaged means it is a plasma estate that is not managed by sinar mas anymore
Division,"Each division belongs to one estate, and each division consist of multiple complexes. "
Complex,"Each complex belongs to one division, and each complex consist of multiple blocks."
Block,Block is the smallest geographical granularity. Each block belongs to one complex.
Period ,"Period refers to the time granularity like month, year, date, MTD, YTD, QTD. Usually it is defined in the question. For example for question is ""Give me FFB production in July 2022 for PSM 3"", the defined period is July 2022. Means data that are supposed to be crawled or calculated are data from time July 2022 only. If the question only have Year only, like 2023, and the datas source has monthly data for each row, then the data have to be agregated, means all 12 months of data for year 2023 have to be summed up before used for any calculation formula. If there is no period defined in the question, can assume that it is for last year data by default, and always tell the user which year or which period is the data is calculated/crawled from. So if the question is ""Please give me the FFB Production for PSM 3"", then assume the period granularity is last year data. If today is 23 February 2024, provide the total FFB production for PSM 3 by sum up ffb production data for all block/complex (depends on the smallest granularity on the dataset) which belong to PSM 3."
MTD,MTD stands for Month to Date. It's a cumulative data or performance metrics from the beginning of the current month up to the present date. 
YTD,YTD stands for Year to Date. It's a cumulative data or performance metrics from the beginning of the current year up to the present date.
QTD,QTD stands for Quarter to Date. It's a cumulative data or performance metrics from the beginning of the current quarter up to the present date. 
Metrics,"Metrics is some KPI (Key Performarce Indicator) that users want to see and analyze. There are many metrics and each metrics has its own meaning and calculation formula. Each metrics value can be defined on 2 types of granularity, which are geographical granularity (PSM, Region, Island, Estate, Division, Complex, Division, Block) and period or time granularity (Year, Month, Date, Month To Date / MTD, Year to Date / YTD, Quarter to Date / QTD). 
Every metrics has its actual, budget, and achievement value. If ""Actual"", ""budget"", or ""achievement"" is not explicitly defined in user's question, Please provide those three values for the respected metric. "
FFB,"FFB stands for Fresh Fruit Bunch, basically a palm fruit. Another terminology for this are TBS (Tandan Buah Segar), Janjang, JJG, JJ, or Buah Sawit. Basically itâ€™s the main harvested output from the estate. The one that harvest the FFB is called Harvester or pemanen. FFB is the whole fruit, a bunches or bundles of many Loose Fruit."
Loose Fruit,"Usually there are Loose Fruits that detached from it's fruit (FFB). The detached fruit is called Loose Fruit. Loose fruit is also called LF, brondolan, brndln, brondol, brndl, brd, or Buah lepas. The one that collect the loose fruit is called Collector or pembrondol."
Harvester,Harvester is the person who harvest the FFB. The output of harvester are the FFBs. Harvester also called Pemanen or harv.
Collecter,Collecter is the person who collect the loose fruit. The output of harvester are Loose fruit. Collecter can also be called pembrondol.
Actual,"The actual value of each metrics. The numbers for actual do have different meanings and unit of measurements depends on the metrics. Actual can also be called act. Generally, actual value will be compared to budget to get the achievement persentage for the respected metrics."
Budget,Budget means benchmark or target to calculate the acievement from the actual value. Budget can also be called bgt.
HK,"HK stands for Hari Kerja (Man Days). It is a unit of measurement (UoM) / metric to calculate certain metrics like Harverster output, harvester coverage, collecter output, collecter coverage."
HA,HA stands for Hectare Area. It's a unit of measurement to measurement (UoM) how big the field is. One HA is equal to 10000 square meters. It's used to calculate certain metrics like Harvester coverage and Collector Coverage.
MT,"MT stands for metric ton. It's a unit of measurement (UoM) to meassure the mass or the weight of the harvested FFB or the collected Loose Fruit. One MT is equal to 1000 kg (kilograms). MT is used as a unit of measurement for certain metrics like FFB Production, Harvester Output, and Collecter Output."
Achievement,"Achievement is used to measure whether the respective metrics has reach it's target value. For most of the metrics, it is a percentage value which calculated by dividing metrics actual value as the numerator, with their budget value as the denumerator. For some metrics like eFact field losses and restan, the calculation for the achievement is different, its not dividing the actual value againts it's budget, but only using its actual value as the achievement."
FFB Production,"It is a metric to show how much FFB is harvested or produced. It is measured in MT (metric ton). It has actual and budget value. To calculate the achievement for this metric is to divide its actual value as the numerator, with its budget value as the denumerator."
Harvester Output,"It is a metrics that have MT per HK as the unit of meassurement. It is used to denotes how much FFB (in MT) is harvested per harvester HK. It's calculated by dividing the harvested FFB in MT as the numerator with HK as the denumerator.  It has actual and budget value. To calculate the achievement for this metric is to divide its actual value as the numerator, with its budget value as the denumerator."
Collector Output,"It is a metrics that have MT per HK as the unit of meassurement. It is used to denotes how much Loose Fruit (in MT) is harvested per collecter HK. It's calculated by dividing the collected Loose Fruit in MT as the numerator with HK as the denumerator.  It has actual and budget value. To calculate the achievement for this metric is to divide its actual value as the numerator, with its budget value as the denumerator."
Harvester Coverage,"Also called ancak pemanen, it is a metrics that have HA per HK as the unit of meassurement. It is used to denotes how many HA can Harvester cover per harvester HK to harvest the FFB. It's calculated by dividing the Harvester HA  as the numerator with HK as the denumerator.  It has actual and budget value. To calculate the achievement for this metric is to divide its actual value as the numerator, with its budget value as the denumerator."
Collector Coverage,"Also called ancak pembrondol, it is a metrics that have HA per HK as the unit of meassurement. It is used to denotes how many HA can collecter cover per collecter HK to harvest the FFB. It's calculated by dividing the collecter HA  as the numerator with HK as the denumerator.  It has actual and budget value. To calculate the achievement for this metric is to divide its actual value as the numerator, with its budget value as the denumerator."
Ancak,"Ancak is the terminology for the coverage area for harvester and collector which has the HA per HK as the unit of measurement. When people talking about ancak, they are talking about Harvester coverage (ancak pemanen), or collecter coverage (ancak pembrondol). "
Harvesting Round,"Denotes how many times the area is harvested (in how many round, round is the unit of measurement) by dividing the total harvested area with the total areal production (harvestable area). The unit of measurement for this metric is ""round""."
Restan,It denotes how many days the harvested FFB or the collected loose fruit has been sitting on the field or estate. It has the actual and budget value. Budget value here means how many days can the harvested FFB or the collected loose fruit can ideally be sitting on the field. So the achievement for this metrics is its own actual value.
Trend,"Trend refers to the comparison of metric value between a pediod granularity. For example, give me the trend of FFB Production for PSM 3 on 2022. then the data provided will be a Month-Over-Month comparison FFB production data on PSM 3 on 2022."
Achievement,"Achievement is used to measure the metric performance. Each metrics has a different formula to measure its achievement. But generally, the achievement is the percentage value of the result of actual value divided by its budget value. Please refer to the metrics data catalog to get the achievement for each metrics"
Perform / performance,"used to measure the performance of either PSM, Estate, Region, or other geographical granularity. It is measure by the achievement of FFB production, the bigger the achievement, means better performance."
